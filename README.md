instructions.

`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][doc]

## Sample programs

If you installed Test with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var test:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs and tests are located in the
[`test`](test) directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
